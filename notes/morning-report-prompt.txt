You are producing a daily Morning Report.

When the report is complete, use the message tool to send it. You MUST specify these parameters:
- action: "send"
- channel: "slack"
- target: "C0AFKPL6LE4"
- text: (your full report)

Format using standard Markdown (the system converts it to Slack format automatically). Use **double asterisks** for bold headlines, [short label](url) for links, and bullet lists. No tables. Be thorough but concise.

CRITICAL: Slack unfurls ALL URLs in a message — even URLs inside markdown links [label](url) — generating large unwanted preview cards. To prevent this:
- For news/HN/Reddit stories: use markdown links [headline](url) (small unfurls are acceptable for these).
- For everything else (GitHub releases, Polymarket, ClawHub, subreddits, etc.): do NOT include the URL at all. Just report the information as plain text. No links, no URLs.

IMPORTANT: Use web_fetch (HTTP) for News Headlines (section 1), Hacker News (section 2), and Reddit (section 3) — these use RSS/JSON APIs that are faster and more reliable than browser scraping. Use the browser tool (CDP browser) for everything else. If any source fails, include a diagnostic note at the end of the report under a "⚠️ Data Collection Issues" section listing each affected source, the tool used (browser vs web_fetch), and the error message or reason for failure (e.g., "browser service unavailable", "bot detection", "cookie wall", "timeout"). This helps diagnose and fix issues for future runs.

If any source is unreachable, note it briefly in that section and move on.

## 1. News Headlines (top 5)
Do NOT use the browser for news — use web_fetch to pull RSS feeds instead. Fetch ALL of these feeds:
- https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml (NYT)
- https://feeds.a.dj.com/rss/RSSWorldNews.xml (WSJ)
- https://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/national (WaPo)
- https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml (BBC)
- https://feeds.npr.org/1001/rss.xml (NPR)
- https://news.google.com/rss?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en (Google News — aggregates Reuters, AP, etc.)

Parse the XML to extract headlines from all feeds. Identify the top 5 most significant stories by looking for topics that appear across multiple feeds. For each, use web_search to get additional context, then write: **bold headline** as a markdown link [headline](article url), source tags showing which outlets covered it, and one sentence on why it matters.

## 2. Hacker News (top 5)
Do NOT use the browser for HN. Instead, use web_fetch to GET https://hnrss.org/frontpage?count=10 — this returns an RSS feed of the current front page with titles, URLs, authors, and comment links. Pick the top 5 stories. For each: **bold title** as a markdown link [title](url), author, and why notable.

## 3. Reddit Trending (top 5)
Do NOT use the browser for Reddit — it will hit a CAPTCHA. Instead, use web_fetch to GET https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/hot.json?limit=10 (set a User-Agent header like "OpenClaw/1.0"). Parse the JSON response: posts are in data.children[].data. For each of the top 5 by score: **bold title** as a markdown link [title](permalink), subreddit name as plain text (do NOT link to the subreddit), score, and significance.

## 4. Google Trends (top 5)
Visit https://trends.google.com/trending?geo=US&hours=24. Top 5 trending searches in the US over the last 24 hours. For each trend, use web_search to look up what actually happened, then write: the trending query, search volume if shown, and a **specific** one-sentence explanation of the underlying event. Do NOT write vague filler like "trending after recent news" — always state what the news is (e.g., "Actor Robert Carradine died at age 68" not "Trending after recent news involving the actor").

## 5. Crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL)
Visit https://www.coingecko.com/. For each: current price, 24h change %, one-line trend.

## 6. OpenClaw Updates
Visit https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases. Any releases in last 24h? If yes, state the version number and summarize the key changes as plain text. Do NOT include any GitHub URL in the output — Slack will unfurl it into a large preview card. If no, say 'No new releases.'

## 7. OpenClaw Skills
Visit https://clawhub.ai/. Any new skills added in the last 24h? If yes, list with brief description and a markdown link [skill name](url). Do NOT include bare URLs. If unavailable or none, just say "No new skills" with no links.

## 8. Clarity Act Odds
Visit https://polymarket.com/event/clarity-act-signed-into-law-in-2026. The odds percentage is inside a `<number-flow-react>` shadow DOM element. To extract it, run this JavaScript in the browser console: `document.querySelector('number-flow-react')?.shadowRoot?.querySelector('.number')?.style.getPropertyValue('--width')` or read the `--current` CSS property from each `.digit` span inside the shadow root to reconstruct the number. Report the current "% chance" and brief state. Do NOT include any Polymarket URL in the output — just report the number as plain text. If unavailable, skip.

## 9. Report Cost
Estimate cost in USD (tokens used, approximate cost).
